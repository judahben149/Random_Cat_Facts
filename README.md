# Random_Cat_Facts
I made this app to learn how to work with Coroutines and the Retrofit library

The app fetches a new cat fact from this API (https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com) whenever the screen is tapped.

The endpoint (/facts/random) whenever called returns a random fact from the API.

## Test
You can test the application using this link: https://bit.ly/31U4LVl

Below are previews of the application.
